<p>We need your help to defend our planet, commander.</p>
<p>Our global defense network targeting system has fallen, and there is no time for repairs, the enemy is already here.</p>
<p>Each of you will be assigned a part of the grid , and it is your task to tell us where to fire.</p>
<p>We're counting on you, cadets. May god help us all.</p>
